## Introduction
This project was completed as Part of Year Two of BSC Software Engineering at the University of Northampton.

It was part of the module CSY2038 - Web Programming and was an assessment of the ability to create a database-driven website using PHP
and MySQL.
This project was weighted for 50% of the module grade. The other 50% is uploaded in a separate repository under the same module name.

## Brief (Summarised)
You are a back-end developer for a web development agency. A local newspaper wants you to build a
website to which they can post news articles. The front-end developer has supplied an HTML layout with
the relevant CSS and Images. This has been signed off by the client and should be used for the look of
the website.

Your task is to implement functionality into the website and allow users at the newspaper to post news
articles. Each news article will have a title, a date, an author and the articleâ€™s text. The company should be
able to log in to a secure administration area and add news stories, entering all the information for the
article, and making it visible to the public.

Each article will fall into a category such as Local News, Sport, Technology or Business. Categories
should not be limited to these choices and new categories should be able to be added via the
administration area.

The public will then be able to browse news articles and filter by category, for example, seeing all news in
the Sports category.

Users should be able to add comments to each news article. The comments for each news article should
be visible below the article text and comments should only be visible on the news article they were posted
to. When a user posts a comment, their name, email address, comment text and date the comment was
posted should be logged and displayed on the page.
